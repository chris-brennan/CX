# Getting Started with the UX Aspects Framework

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.5.3.  

This application utilizes the UX Aspects user interface framework and provides a great place to start for building modern, 
responsive, mobile big data applications on the web.

# Documentation and Examples

## Prerequisites

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) - this provides the `npm` command, which is used to install application dependencies.

## Installation

1. Clone the [CX](https://github.com/MicroFocus/CX) repository.

2. In the command line go to the `hello-world-ux-aspects` directory.

3. Run `npm install`

    **Note:** If you cannot configure the `@micro-focus` scope then the internal NPM registry is not accessible from your network, [contact us](https://pages.github.houston.softwaregrp.net/caf/ux-aspects-micro-focus/#/team) and we will be glad to provide the required packages along with instructions for use.

## Development server

* Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI README](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/README.md).
